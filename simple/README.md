simple version
===
This is standard LSTM implementation, using epoch-wise BPTT training algorithm.

TODO:  
---
* Due to limited APIs of CuVector, current code mixes both vector and matrix representations for computation. 
May add DiffSigmoid, DiffTanh to CuVector to clean it up.
* bi-directional LSTM
